**Catch the Egg** is a simple game of reflexes and control perception, where the main goal is to catch a falling egg using a frying pan controlled by the keyboard arrows.

The game consists of 3 trials with N attempts each. Before starting, the player must register their personal information:
- Name
- Age
- Gender
- Participant number

After each trial, the participant answers three questions on a scale from 1 to 7:
- How well did you do?
- Did you feel you had control?
- How confident are you that you had control?

## Psychological Background

It is based on the study of agency and perception of control, two central concepts in cognitive psychology and neuroscience.
- Agency refers to the subjective experience of being the author of one's own actions and their consequences in the world.
- Perception of control is the belief or feeling that one can influence events through one's actions.

In this game, through covert manipulations of the real control over the pan (either in favor of or against the player), it evaluates how people perceive their performance and their level of control, even when it is objectively altered without their knowledge. The design allows investigation into:
- Whether participants detect the loss or alteration of control.
- How their perception of success and control varies depending on whether the environment helps or hinders them, even if they believe they are in control.

These phenomena are relevant for understanding how people interpret their actions in contexts of uncertainty or external manipulation, and have applications in fields such as clinical psychology, neuropsychology, and human-machine interface design.
